# Django-Issuetrack

Should mimic in functionality that of the issue tracker used for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories.

You can create projects, project components, issues and comments. Added login functionality and user identification.

## Appearance

Uses the Django admin css files and looks very similar to Django admin.
